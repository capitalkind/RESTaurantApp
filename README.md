The aim of this project was to create a comprehensive management system, from cooks, to servers, to administrators. Beginning with an ERD, this app was built with simplicity and usability in mind.

<h3>Useability</h3>
The Admin has the ability to oversee and alter all current parties, orders, and servers in the resturant. The Server can create, edit and update the status of parties and orders. Finally, the cook has a view of the kitchen where orders to be prepared are populated with color coded time paramaters. Multiple Servers and Cooks can attend to the RESTurant's patrons from any device.
